# Responsive Web Design

RWD is an approach taken when designing and developing a website that aims to provide the optimal viewing experience for any user.
Typically that means factoring in the device size, orientation, and it's screen's pixel density.
This definition is sometimes extended to include other things that impact the UX,
like network speed and quality, device speed, browser compatibility and even the user's disabilities (bad eyesight, color blindness, etc).
